</p>

A differential drive robot is controlled using ROS2 Humble running on a Raspberry Pi 4 (running Ubuntu server 22.04). The vehicle is equipped with a Raspberry Pi camera for visual feedback and an RPlidar A1 sensor used for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance. Additionally, an MPU6050 inertial measurement unit (IMU) is employed by the `robot_localization` package on the robot, to fuse IMU sensor data and the wheel encoders data, using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) node, to provide more accurate robot odometry estimates.

Hardware components are written for the Waveshare Motor Driver HAT and MPU6050 sensor to be accessed by the `ros2_control` differential drive controller and Imu sensor broadcaster respectively, via the `ros2_control` resource manager.

### Project Wiring and Assembly

The MPU6050 board pins were connected to the Raspberry Pi 4 GPIO pins as follows for use with the I2C communication protocol:

| MPU6050 board | GPIO.BOARD | GPIO.BCM |
| ------------- | ---------- | -------- |
| VCC           | 3.3V       | 3.3V     |

| D10                | IN2 (L Fwd) |
| Red wire (R 12V)   | OUT1        |
| White wire (R GND) | OUT2        |
| Red wire (L 12V)   | OUT3        |
| White wire (L GND) | OUT4        |

| Arduino Nano pin | Connected to Encoder Motor |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| D2               | Yellow wire (Left motor A) |
| D3               | Yellow wire (Left motor B) |
